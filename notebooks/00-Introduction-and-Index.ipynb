The dataset has an entry for every fish caught, almost 2,000 over the last 10 years, and includes simple weather metrics around when the fish was caught along with some information on the fish caught. The logs contain some useful information and context for each fish, however they (and other columns) contain sensitive information. For that reason the raw data is not shared and the cleaned data is available instead."],"metadata":{"id":"JwiD6ui9Dj7w"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The goal of these notebooks is to clean the data into a presentable form, use online weather APIs to collect more information, perform simple data analysis and exploration, and fit some models for predicting good fishing days"],"metadata":{"id":"3qmoX4_iP0l2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The fisherman who collected this data is my father, and he was kind enough to let me share the cleaned version with anyone who might want to explore it."],"metadata":{"id":"o3gt9JRKPAp7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Table of Contents"],"metadata":{"id":"n8RzYP2rF7i_"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 1.
