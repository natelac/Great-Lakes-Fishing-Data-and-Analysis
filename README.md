# Great Lakes Fishing Data and Analysis

The data in this repository was collected on the southern shore of Lake Superior, the largest freshwater lake on the planet. The dataset is very messy and has some quirky features. You can download a clean version of the data in the `data` directory. If you are interested in data cleaning, data analysis, or model fitting checkout the `notebooks` directory starting with the [Introduction and Index](https://github.com/natelac/Great-Lakes-Fishing-Data-and-Analysis/blob/main/notebooks/00-Introduction-and-Index.ipynb). If some of the graphs are too small or you want to checkout the EBM model, use the [google colab](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G9bTWalcd1IADgLsdGyDG5u_tdz0LGqU?usp=share_link) version.

## Todo
- Use `pip freeze` to create a list of dependancies for the `.ipynb` files
- Create a data_description.txt describing each of the features and how to interpret them
