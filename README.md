# Great Lakes Fishing
## Todo

### Now
- Do a first pass on fitting models
- Anonymize data
- Get historical weather
  - `temp`, `dew`, `humidity`, `precip`, `windgust`, `windspeed`, `winddir`, `pressure`, and `cloudcover` for `starttime`, `endtime`, and `time` for every row
  - Could probably come up with metrics for days preceding fishing days to determine if a big storm has gone through and turned the waters over
- Redo old metrics, and explore new ones
- Refit models
- Write story

### Later
- Use `pip freeze` to create a list of dependancies for the `.ipynb` files.
- Compile (here or in a notebook) a list of things that you didn't control for / were iffy on. Also recommend what steps should be taken when constructing a new dataset.
