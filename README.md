The data in this repository was collected on the southern shore of the Lake Superior, the largest freshwater lake on the planet. You can download a clean version of the data in the `data` directory. If you are interested in data cleaning, data analysis, or model fitting checkout the `notebooks` directory.

## How to check it out

You can start reading it on github in the `notebooks` directory starting with the [Introduction and Index](https://github.com/natelac/Great-Lakes-Fishing-Data-and-Analysis/blob/main/notebooks/00-Introduction-and-Index.ipynb).

If you want to view the EBM model you will need to check it out on [google colab](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G9bTWalcd1IADgLsdGyDG5u_tdz0LGqU?usp=share_link). You won't be able to load in the data on google colab, and will need to download it if you want to modify anything.

## Todo
- Use `pip freeze` to create a list of dependancies for the `.ipynb` files.
